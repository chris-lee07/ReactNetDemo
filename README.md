# ReactNetDemo
Demo application to learn about React, Redux, Cypress, and C# along with all the intricacies of application development. This application skeleton was created using Microsoft's "React and .NET Core" template that can be found packaged in Visual Studio.

## Client Side
The client side application will consist of the following components:
1. React
2. Redux
3. Cypress

Instead of JavaScript, we are using TypeScript to emulate strong-typing in our client-side code.

After building and running the application in Visual Studio, you should be able to render the client-side application via the following URL: https://localhost:61255

## Backend Side
The backend of the application will be created leveraging C#, .NET, and DbUp.

In order to access/test out API changes, please refer to the following URL that will render the Swagger/OpenAPI interface: https://localhost:7027/swagger/index.html
